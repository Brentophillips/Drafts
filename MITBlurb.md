# Humanitarian AI @ MIT

The humanitarian community is working concertedly to make aid activity information more transparent and accessible to machine applications.

**Humanitarian AI** is launching a new initiative giving university students opportunities to help develop and train artificial intelligent applications capable of processing information streaming through open data sharing frameworks like **IATI** or stored in repositories like the **Humanitarian Data Exchange**.

Inspired by **Kaggle** and based in Cambridge, Massachusetts between **Harvard** and **MIT**, the initiative will focus on making data, computing resources, research opportunities, coordination and technical advisors available to students, our community members and to others interested in collaborating on advancing the Humanitarian AI and more broadly the AI for Good fields.
