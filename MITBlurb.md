**Humanitarian AI** is launching a new initiative giving university students opportunities to work with our community members on developing and training artificial intelligent applications capable of processing information streaming through open data sharing frameworks like **IATI** and stored in repositories like the **Humanitarian Data Exchange**.

Inspired by **Kaggle** and situated in Cambridge, Massachusetts between Harvard and MIT, the initiative will focus on making data, computing resources, research opportunities, coordination and technical advisors available to students, our community members and to members of partner initiatives like **Omdena** whose members are similarly working on advancing the state-of-the-art in the Humanitarian AI and more broadly the AI for Good fields.
