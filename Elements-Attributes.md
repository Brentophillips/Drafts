# IATI Elements and Attributes 

**Humanitarian AI community microproject** focusing on creating a **correlation table** listing IATI information fields (XML elements and attributes) and corresponding JSON and Neo4j compatable versions of the fields.

This project will support two connected projects, one researching how IATI XML data can be converted into JSON ([IATI-JSON]()) and another looking at how IATI data can be extracted and stored in a Neo4j graph database ([IATI-Graph]()).
