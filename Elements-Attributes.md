# IATI Elements and Attributes 

This microproject will generate a correlation table listing IATI information fields (XML elements and attributes) and field versions that are JSON and graph database compatable. This project will support two related projects, one looking at how IATI data can be converted to JSON ([IATI-JSON]()) and another looking at how IATI data can be stored in a graph database ([IATI-Graph]()).

## Get Involved

Volunteers are needed to:

* Create an up-to-date list of IATI XML elements and attributes
* Convert these into JSON versions that can symultaniously be used to store data in a Neo4j graph database.
* Help research and list possible new IATI XML fields and add these to the conversion table
* Examine IATI codelist properties (attributes) and values and try to identify values that might cause database errors
