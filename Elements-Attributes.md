# IATI Elements and Attributes 

**Humanitarian AI community microproject** focusing on creating a **correlation table** listing IATI information fields (XML elements and attributes) and corresponding JSON and Neo4j compatable versions of the fields.

This project will support two connected projects, one researching how IATI XML data can be converted into JSON ([IATI-JSON]()) and another looking at how IATI data can be extracted and stored in a Neo4j graph database ([IATI-Graph]()).

## Tasks

Before contributing, volunteers are encourged to [sign-up]() to join the community's team on GitHub and our workspace on Slack and follow this project's Slack channel.

Task-wise, help is needed to:
* Create and maintain an up-to-date list of IATI XML elements and attributes
* Research and convert IATI fields into JSON and Neo4j compatible versions
* Help research and list possible new IATI XML fields and add these to the conversion table
* Examine IATI codelist properties (attributes) and values and try to identify values that might cause database errors
