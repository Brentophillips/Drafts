# MIT Humanitarian AI Initiative

The recently launched [National Research Cloud](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/technology/national-cloud-computing-project.html) and Microsofts [Planetary Computer](https://innovation.microsoft.com/en-us/planetary-computer) are two new initiativs striving to make data and comuting power more accessible to students and researchers advancing artificial intelligence.

The Humanitarian AI Community is teaming up universities like MIT, tech companies and humanitarian stakeholders to make vast amounts of data and sophisticated computing resources availible to students, community members and others to use to tackle some of the hardest challenges standing in the way of advancing the application of artificial intellgence by humanitarian organizations. Our initiative will assemble the resources needed, coordinate projects based on a roadmap and assemble a expansive advisory board to oversee and guide the initiative and the thrust of resarch and development activities.

## Getting Started 2020

The humanitarian community has been working concertedly to standardize how aid activities are reported and to establish data sharing channels and repositories accessible to machine applications and emerging artificial intelligent applications.

The project will concentrate on tackling the technical work needed to make this data research ready and useful on an entrprise grade level and begin working out delivery and handeling architecture (in the same way Kaggle was setup to make data accessible to researchers and by doing so facilitate research...).

We're starting with IATI data...

* Evaluate three principle ways of accessing IATI Data, extract a whole corpus snapshot and work out how to maintain a master clone that's up-to-date to a day (via an XMl database or another), including a change log
* Research and optimize a graphical format
* Prepare and maintin a graph database
